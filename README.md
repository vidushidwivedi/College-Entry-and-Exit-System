# College-Entry-and-Exit-System

## Description
The college gate has a biometric system installed that requires students to punch in with their fingertip before entering. The system scans the student's fingertip and verifies their identity with the college's database. After successful verification, the student can enter the college premises.

The gate is managed by college guards who are responsible for monitoring the biometric system and ensuring that only authorised students enter the premises. The guards scan the students after punching to keep a lookout for any suspicious activity.


## Features

- With this model, we could run simulations to test the effectiveness of the biometric system and the guards in preventing unauthorised access to the college premises.

- We could also use the simulations to optimise the system by tweaking the parameters and variables to find the best possible configuration.
